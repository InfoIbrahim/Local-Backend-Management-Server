This code is an example of how to integrate NFC (Near Field Communication) card reading functionality with a Python program. It uses the smartcard library to interact with NFC readers and perform actions based on the scanned NFC card's unique identifier (UID). Here's how this code relates to the previous Django application:

1. Reading NFC Tags (Card Scanning):
The primary goal of this code is to read an NFC card and retrieve its unique identifier (UID). When a card is placed on the NFC reader, the program scans it and associates it with a unique IHB number (an identifier for some asset or value in your Django application).
The function read_nfc_tag simulates the scanning process, and check_for_card ensures that a card is present. When a card is detected, its UID is retrieved.
2. Integration with the Django Application:
In the Django application, users are associated with IHB numbers (via ownership of assets). This code could be extended to assign or track an IHB number for each NFC card and then associate the scanned NFC card with specific user actions in the Django app.
The IHB_number that is assigned to each NFC card (via the variable IHB_number_number) could be linked to a user's asset, allowing them to perform actions (like checking balances or transferring ownership) related to that specific IHB in the Django app.
3. NFC Data Processing with Node.js:
The run_node_script function runs a Node.js script (processNFC.js) after an NFC tag is read, passing the IHB_number as a parameter.

Relation to Django: This could be used to process NFC data (e.g., handle asset transactions or validate user identity) in real time. The Node.js script could perform operations like verifying the card's IHB number and then communicate that back to the Django application or database to update user data or logs.

Example: After scanning an NFC tag, the system could check if the tag corresponds to a valid user in the Django system, verify ownership, or handle transactions related to the scanned IHB number.

4. Logging NFC Data:
The program logs NFC tag scans in a JSON file (nfc_data.json) along with timestamps and associated IHB numbers. It also tracks which NFC UID is mapped to which IHB number.
Relation to Django: This log file (nfc_data.json) could be used to store additional information that integrates with the Django backend. For example, when a user scans an NFC tag, the backend can reference this file to update ownership records or display transaction history on the dashboard.
5. UID-to-IHB Mapping:
The code maintains a mapping of NFC UID to IHB numbers (uid_to_IHB_number) and assigns a new IHB number to a previously unassigned UID. This ensures that each unique NFC card is tied to a distinct IHB number in the system.
Relation to Django: In your Django app, you could use this mapping to assign ownership of an IHB to a user. If a user scans a new card (with an unassigned UID), the system can create a new entry in the user’s account, linking them to a new IHB number. Alternatively, if the UID has already been mapped to an IHB number, the system could fetch the existing data and display it to the user.
6. Error Handling:
There are error handling mechanisms throughout the code to ensure the NFC card reading process runs smoothly. If no card is detected, the program waits for the next scan. If an error occurs while reading the card, the system prints an error message and terminates the process.
Relation to Django: If the system encounters issues (like no NFC reader connected or card read failure), it could show an error message in the frontend or log the error in Django, allowing for easy debugging.
7. JSON Data File:
The nfc_data.json file stores the UID-IHB mappings, which are loaded at the start of the program and saved back to disk whenever a new UID is assigned an IHB number.
Relation to Django: This JSON file could be integrated with the Django app’s database, ensuring that any NFC-related data is accessible for further processing in the Django views, such as checking user ownership of assets or transactions. The file might serve as a simple storage mechanism before syncing with the main database.
8. Data Flow:
Scan NFC Card: The NFC card is read by the Python script, which then checks if the UID already has an associated IHB number.
Process IHB Number: If the UID is new, a new IHB number is generated and assigned to the card. The log entry is saved with the UID and IHB number in the nfc_data.json file.
Update Django Data: If needed, this NFC data could be sent to the Django backend (via an API or direct integration) to update the user's IHB ownership or transaction history.
Run Node.js Script: The system could trigger additional processing through the Node.js script, perhaps for advanced logic (e.g., handling financial transactions based on NFC scans).
Possible Integration Steps:
Backend Integration: You could extend the functionality to send data from this NFC reader and nfc_data.json to the Django backend via an API. This would allow real-time synchronization of NFC scans with user accounts and asset ownership records.
User Interaction: After a card is scanned and associated with an IHB number, the Django app could display the corresponding IHB data on the user's dashboard, allowing them to take actions such as transferring ownership or viewing the value of their assets.
Summary of the Integration:
The Python script reads NFC tags, assigns IHB numbers, and saves logs to a JSON file. This data could be used in the Django application to manage user ownership of IHBs. Additionally, the integration of Node.js allows for processing or validation of NFC data before updating the Django system.
